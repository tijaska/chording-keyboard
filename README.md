This is an HTML page with embedded JavaScript that illustrates how a handheld device with a limited number
of buttons (one per finger / thumb) could be used to enter text, by pressing various selections of buttons
at a time.  The HTML demo is purely illustrative, it is not meant to be a practical implementation.
